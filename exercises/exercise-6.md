# Exercise 6 - Playing a Game

A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the `playGame` function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the `playGame` body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the `HAND_SIZE` constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.

**Testing**: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for `HAND_SIZE` with your program, and be sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable `HAND_SIZE`.
